Snake Game 

How to play ?
Playing the classic Snake game is pretty simple! Here's a basic rundown:

1. Objective:The goal is to control the snake, guiding it to eat food (usually represented by dots), and as it eats, it grows longer. The game ends when the snake either crashes into itself or the boundaries of the playing area.
2.Controls: Typically, you control the snake using arrow keys on your keyboard. Each arrow key corresponds to a direction: up, down, left, and right. The snake will continuously move in the direction indicated by the last arrow key pressed.
3. Gameplay: The snake starts as a small line segment, usually in the middle of the game board. It moves in a straight line in the direction you've indicated. Your job is to steer it around obstacles and towards the food.
4. Eating Food: When the snake's head (the front segment) collides with a piece of food, it consumes the food, and its length increases by one segment. The food then reappears at a random location on the game board.
5. Growing Longer: As the snake consumes more food, it grows longer. This can make it increasingly challenging to navigate without colliding with itself.
6. Game Over: The game ends if the snake's head collides with any part of its own body (except the tail) or if it collides with the boundaries of the game board.
7. Scoring: In some versions, the score increases with each piece of food consumed. The longer the snake becomes, the higher your score.
8. Challenge: As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging as you need to maneuver it through a crowded board without crashing.
9. Variations: There are many variations of Snake with different features and levels of difficulty, but the basic gameplay remains the same.
